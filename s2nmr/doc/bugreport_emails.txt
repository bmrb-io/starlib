Subject: v2.1 to v3 conversion

I used the following commend to run the conversion.

/bmrb/linux/bin/s2nmr /bmrb/etc/nmrstr3.0-nmrstr2.1_prod.str v3.file -o 2.1file

There are few more problems with 2.1 output file.

1. The tag and its value:

_Entry.Release_request       "On publication"

got carried to 2.1 file, but they are not valid in 2.1, for "On publication"
release request, the corrosponding tags in 2.1 are:

   _Release_immediately      no
   _Release_on_publication   yes

2. The three letter residue label in the polymer got repeated in the same loop.

3. One polymer would only have one saveframe in the v2.1, but in the output file
there were two saveframe generated.

4. For system that contains more than one polymer, the shift table was not
splitted in the 2.1 output file.

I have a example entry reside in the following directory:

/share/jundong/21to30

Thanks,
Jundong

Subject: About NMR v3 to 2.1

Hi, Steve,

I just converted one entry from NMRStar v3 to 2.1, it is good to see the
problems we had before were fixed. But there are few more problems:

1. Since neither this tag or the value is valid in the 2.1 dictionary

    _Release_request        "On publication"

should be replaced by the following tags

   _Release_immediately       no _Release_on_publication    yes

2. For residual dipolar couplings the right value for  _Saveframe_category_type
is residual_dipolar_couplings, the value I had in the file was "RDCs"

3. The entry's study was a homo dimer(RNA), in this case there should be two
components in the system, both point to one polymer saveframe. And there
should  be a magnetic equivalent loop inserted for these two component. The
converted file got two polymer saveframe for the same polymer, first saveframe
inherited the polymer type correctly as "RNA", but the residue sequence was
repeated. And the second polymer the polymer type was set as "protein", the
validator will try convert these RNA residue name into three letter protein
name according to this value. It might be hard to have the program to attend
all these issue, but since the goal is the have automatic conversion with no
human intervention, I should let you know all these challenges.

4. In the residual dipolar couplings saveframe following tags and values were
missing in 2.1 file

   _Sample_conditions          $conditions_2 _Spectrometer_frequence_1H   600
   _Mol_system_component_name  "GAAA tetraloop 11-nt receptor RNA strand 1"

They are mandatory tags and they have corresponding values in the v3 file.

The v3 file I converted was:

/share/subedit/Third.Ed/bmr6652/bmr6652_3.str

The command I ran the conversion was:

/bmrb/linux/bin/s2nmr /bmrb/etc/nmrstr3.0-nmrstr2.1_prod.str bmr6652_3.str -o
bmr6652_21.str

Thanks,
Jundong

Hi Steve,

There are a few issues that need to be fixed in the conversion of 3.0 to 2.1 format.

1.  Missing tag:

save_contact_persons

2.  Missing values for the tag:

      _Atom_isotope_number


Thank you,

I'm confused.  That's the name of a saveframe.  What is the missing
tag inside the saveframe you are referring to?

I'll look at this when I get back from the class.

Sorry for the confusion.  I mean the name of this saveframe.

Hi Steve,

I encounter some problem of converting version 3.0 to 2.1 for entry 6516.  The
saveframe of ligand PNS is missing.  Would you please check it out when you have
time?

Hi,

I used the production version to convert the entry 6546 from 3.0 to 2.1, and
found some serious problem other than the format or comments.  Please make sure
to consider them when you update the script.  The pre-edit version is
"bmr6546_21.str-old-11".  It listed the residue sequence twice in the same loop,
and the monomeric saveframe was listed twice (where the second one list the one
letter code).

Thank you for your help,
Hongyang

Hi Steve,

When I convert entry 6860, I noticed another problem.  The whole saveframe of
"NMR_applied_experiment" was missing.  It is more critical and urgent than
previously reported problems.

Hope you can modify the script when you have time.

Subject: Comments for the 3.0 to 2.1 conversion

Hi Steve,

Today, I used the 3.0 to 2.1 script to convert the entries (6732 -6735).
Here are the comments:

1.  The following tag is not valid:

    _Release_request

The correct one in 2.1 version should be:

    _Release_date_request

2.  The following tag and its value are missing:

   _Mol_polymer_class      protein

3.  For the saveframe of "crosslink_bonds", the following line is missing:

    save_crosslink_bond_definitions

4.  The value "protein" for the following tag is not right, and it should be
"monomer", or "dimer", etc.

    _System_oligomer_state


Hope you can modify the script when you have time.

Thanks,
Hongyang

-------Additional ones afterward-----------

"NMR_applied_experiment" was missing.  It is more critical and urgent than

-----------------------------------------

Another thing about the conversion is that ligands or non-standard residues
saveframe get converted into two saveframes. But only one is necessary.

Thank you.  I used the new script and found that there are still something
missing.  The following tags need to be addede to the T2 loop:

        _T2.Entity_assembly_ID
        _T2.Entity_ID

Hope you can modify it again when you have time.  I have done this entry

Please add the following to the list of comments of 3.0 to 2.1 comments.

For entry 6577, the following are missing after conversion:

1.  T1 data loop;
2.  T2 saveframe;

and there are too many tags in the data loop for S2 values.

(This is in reference to the splitting and joining of the methyls in chemical shifts loops.
There is still one issue unresolved)

Ah  - I see why that is happening.
When the ambiguity list contains references to some of the collapsed
methyls, in 3.0 it had to list all the parts seperately.  (In the
above example, it used to point at a HD11, HD12, and HD13 that were on
row 942, 943, and 944, but after collapsing it became just one row, on
row 860.  The first instance of '860' in the comma-separated list is
the one that used to point at 942. the second 860 is the one that used
to point at 943, and the third 860 is the one that used to point at
944.  I think I know an easy way to fix this, but eldon wants me to
spend 100% of my time on pdbx/nmrif conversion right now, so I won't
be able to get to it right away.)
