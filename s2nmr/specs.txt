Part 1: Transforming generic STAR to NMR-STAR
-----

Kinds of data transformations needed to make generic STAR into NMR-STAR:

1) One-to-one mappings of (tag, value) pairs
 1a) Renaming tags:
     The tag is renamed, but the value is unchanged.  This also handles
     the trivial case of writing out tags whose name doesn't change.  Renamed
tags
     that are moved between saveframes (the _old_saveframe and _new_saveframe
     values are different) will not appear in loops;  there are other
transformations
     to do that.

     syntax:
     save_renamed_tags
     loop_
       _old_tag_name
       _old_saveframe
       _new_tag_name
       _new_saveframe

     "_author_name"
     "save_citation"
     "_submittor_name"
     "save_primary_citation"
     ...

     effect:
     generic STAR 		NMR-STAR

     _author_name "bob jones"	_submittor_name "bob jones"

 1b) Replacing values with framecodes:
     The users will often refer to a save frame just by giving its
     name.  To make this into into a framecode, prepend a "$" to the
     value, and replace whitespace with underscores.  It is not
     necessary to verify that this framecode points to an existing
     saveframe.

     syntax:
     save_tag_to_framecode
     loop_
       _old_tag_name
       _old_saveframe

     "_reporting_conditions"
     "save_experiment"
     ...

     effect:
     generic STAR 				NMR-STAR

     _reporting_conditions "conditions 1"	_reporting_conditions
$conditions_1

 1c) Renaming keyed tags:
     A variation on 1a).  Sometimes, we do not know the name of the saveframe
     to search for the tag (for instance, if the saveframe name was derived
     from a tag value by 2).  Rather than altering the tag based on its
     existance in a particular saveframe, the tag is altered if it is in
     the same saveframe as another tag (the key) that takes a particular
     value (the key value).


     syntax:
     save_keyed_renamed_tags
     loop_
       _key_tag
       _key_value
       _old_tag_name
       _new_tag_name

     "_saveframe_category"
     "author"
     "_author_name"
     "_submittor_name"
     ...

     effect:
     generic STAR 		NMR-STAR

     _author_name "bob jones"	_submittor_name "bob jones"

2) Mapping (tag, value) pairs to changes in scope
   Creating save frames from values:  Often, users entering data into
   AutoDep will need to create new save frames to be later referenced
   with framecodes.  The only way to define these new save frames is to
   read them in in data tags, however.

   There are three cases in which the data tag appears:
   I)   In a collection of free tags, possibly followed by tags in loops.
   II)  In a loop, possibly preceeded by free tags.
   III) In a saveframe containing several loops, each with its own
        change-of-scope tag.


   Case I:
   In this case, the entire contents of the old saveframe containing
   the tag is placed into the new saveframe, regardless of where the
   tag appears.  The tag may appear anywhere before the first loop.

   syntax:
   save_tag_to_scope
   loop_
     _old_tag_name
     _old_saveframe

   "_new_molecule_code"
   "save_new_molecules"


   effect:
   generic STAR 			  NMR-STAR

   save_new_molecules			  save_hmgb
   _new_molecule_type protein		  _new_molecule_type protein
   _new_molecule_name "hemoglobin bombay" _new_molecule_name "hemoglobin
bombay"
   _new_molecule_code hmgb
					  loop_
   loop_				    _residue
     _residue				    a s t r p m
     a s t r p m			    stop_
     stop_				    save_
   save_


   Case II:
   In this case, any tags in the old saveframe before the loop are left
   in the old saveframe, and a new saveframe is made with the data
   items in each iteration of the loop.

   syntax:
   save_tag_to_scope
   loop_
     _old_tag_name
     _old_saveframe

   "_new_molecule_code"
   "save_new_molecules"

   effect:
   generic STAR 			NMR-STAR

   save_new_molecules			save_new_molecules
   _creation_date "9 May 1997"		_creation_date "9 May 1997"
   _created_by "evil dave"		_created_by "evil dave"
                                        save_

   loop_				save_hmgb
     _new_molecule_code			_new_molecule_name "hemoglobin bombay"
     _new_molecule_name			_new_molecule_type "heme protein"
     _new_molecule_type
					save_
   "hmgb"  "hemoglobin bombay"
   "heme protein"			save_pen
   "pen"  "penicillin" "antibiotic"	_new_molecule_name "penicillin"
   					_new_molecule_type "antibiotic"

   save_				save_


   Case III:
   In this case, a new saveframe is made with the data for each loop
   iteration. Each loop will have exactly one change-of-scope tag.

   syntax:
   save_tag_to_scope
   loop_
     _old_tag_name
     _old_saveframe

   "_new_molecule_code"
   "save_new_molecules"
   "_experimenter_last_name"
   "save_new_molecules"


   effect:
   generic STAR 			NMR-STAR

   save_new_molecules
   loop_				save_hmgb
     _new_molecule_code			_new_molecule_name "hemoglobin bombay"
     _new_molecule_name			_new_molecule_type "heme protein"
     _new_molecule_type
					save_
   "hmgb"  "hemoglobin bombay"
   "heme protein"			save_pen
   "pen"  "penicillin" "antibiotic"	_new_molecule_name "penicillin"
   stop_				_new_molecule_type "antibiotic"

   loop_				save_
     _experimenter_first_name
     _experimenter_initial		save_Jones
     _experimenter_last_name		_experimenter_first_name Bob
   Bob I Jones				_experimenter_initial I
   Joe M Smith				save_
   stop_
   save_				save_Smith
					_experimenter_first_name Joe
					_experimenter_initial M
					save_

   Case IV:
   In this case, the original saveframe contains at least one loop that isn't
   made into a new saveframe.  Such saveframes should simply be left in the
   original saveframe.  (This Case is included only for completeness.  It
doesn't
   require any new software or dictionary entries.)

3) Mapping sets of (tag, value) pairs to loops
 3a) Mapping tag names into values:
     To make the interface (that generates ZINC/generic STAR) easier to
     understand, sets of items that are recorded as NMR-STAR loops are
     read as unlooped tags.  Generally, one of the *tags* read into the
     generic STAR is a *value* in the NMR-STAR loop.  In addition to
     the tags being renamed, the name of a tag being used as a value is
     inserted into the value of another in NMR-STAR, with the leading
     underscore removed.

     syntax:
     save_tag_to_value
     loop_
       _old_tag_name
       _old_saveframe
       _new_tag_name
       _tag_name_becomes_value

     "_ph" 		"save_conditions" 	"_condition" 	"yes"
     "_ph" 		"save_conditions" 	"_value"     	"no"
     "_ph_error" 	"save_conditions" 	"_error" 	"no"
     "_temperature" 	"save_conditions" 	"_condition" 	"yes"
     "_temperature" 	"save_conditions" 	"_value" 	"no"
     "_temperature_error" "save_conditions" 	"_error" 	"no"
     ....

     effect:

     generic STAR 		NMR-STAR

     save_conditions		save_conditions
     _ph 7			loop_
     _ph_error 0.1		  _condition
     _temperature 25		  _value
     _temperature_error 0.01	  _error
     save_
				ph 	7 	0.1
				temperature	25	0.01

				stop_
				save_


 3b) Parsing values into loops

     Occasionally, a single generic STAR tag holds a set of closely
     related data that are represented in NMR-STAR as a loop.  The
     value has to be read, and broken up in a loop based on a specified
     delimitter or field width.

     syntax:
     save_value_to_loop
     loop_
       _old_tag_name
       _old_saveframe
       _new_tag_name
       _delimitter
       _width

     "_sequence"
     "save_molecule_description"
     "_residue"
     .
     "1"
     ...


     effect:

     generic STAR 	NMR-STAR

     _sequence		loop_
     acerytal 		  _residue

			  a c e r
    			  y t a l

			stop_


In practice this is a rare occurance, and would only be used in conjunction
with other transformations (1b and 4a).

3c) Mapping keyed tag names into values
    A variation on 3a.  Sometimes, we do not know the name of the saveframe
    to search for the tag (for instance, if the saveframe name was derived
    from a tag value by 2).  Rather than altering the tag based on its
    existance in a particular saveframe, the tag is altered if it is in
    the same saveframe as another tag (the key) that takes a particular
    value (the key value).

     syntax:
     save_keyed_tag_to_value
     loop_
       _old_tag_name
       _key_tag
       _key_value
       _new_tag_name
       _tag_name_becomes_value

     "_ph" 		"_marker"   "best run"	"_condition" 	"yes"
     "_ph" 		"_marker"   "best run"	"_value"     	"no"
     "_ph_error" 	"_marker"   "best run"	"_error" 	"no"
     "_temperature" 	"_marker"   "best run"	"_condition" 	"yes"
     "_temperature" 	"_marker"   "best run"	"_value" 	"no"
     "_temperature_error" "_marker" "best run"	"_error" 	"no"
     ....

     effect:

     generic STAR 		NMR-STAR

     save_conditions_1		save_conditions_1
     _marker "best run"		_marker "best run"
     _ph 7			loop_
     _ph_error 0.1		  _condition
     _temperature 25		  _value
     _temperature_error 0.01	  _error
     save_
				ph 	7 	0.1
				temperature	25	0.01

				stop_
				save_


4) manipulating the generic STAR file based on its content
 4a) Retreiving text based on (tag, value) pairs
     The generic STAR file contains special (tag, value) pairs that map
     onto more complex, pre-defined NMR-STAR objects.  (This is done
     for the convenience of AutoDep users.)  These objects need to be
     inserted into the generic STAR file, replacing the (tag, value)
     pair that reference them, being inserted into the current scope,
     or being appended to the file.  Replacements of (tag, value) pairs
     go into the current scope.

     syntax:
     save_tag_file_retrieval
     loop_
       _old_tag_name
       _old_saveframe
       _value
       _replace_insert_append
       _new_text

     "_conditions"
     "save_experiment"
     "$conditions_1"
     "append"
     ;
     save_conditions_1
     [...rest of STAR definitions]
     save_
     ;

     "_experiment_name"
     "save_experiment"
     "user defined"
     "insert"
     ;
     _experiment_type .
     ;

     "_equipment_used"
     "save_experiment"
     "supergauss 400"
     "replace"
     ;
     _instrument_type $wide_bore_spectrometer
     _instrument_name "supergauss 400"
     ;
     _stop

     generic STAR			NMR-STAR

     save_experiment			save_experiment
     _conditions  $conditions_1		_conditions  $conditions_1
     _experiment_name "user defined"	_experiment_name "user defined"
     _experimentor "bob jones"		_experiment_type .
     _equipment_used "supergauss 400"	_instrument_type
$wide_bore_spectrometer
     _save				_instrument_name "supergauss 400"
					_save
                                        [...rest of NMR-STAR file]
					save_conditions_1
					[...rest of STAR definitions]
					save_

     Note:  This operation is often used with transformation 1b, so
     that users can refer to objects already in BMRB very easily.  Also
     note that in some cases, we will desire to operate on a tag
     regardless of its value.  In those cases, the _value tag in the
     loop will contain *.

 4b) File insertion based on (tag, value) pairs
     Certain tags contain the name of a STAR file to be appended to the
     generic STAR file.  The (tag, value) pair is deleted and the file
     added to the in-memory generic STAR representation.

     syntax:
     save_value_to_filename
     loop_
       _old_tag_name
       _old_saveframe


     effect:
     (depends on the contents of the file)

5 Removing unneeded (tag, value) pairs
  Some tags produced by the Autodep software are not needed for further
  processing of the data.  This transformation deletes these (tag, value)
  pairs.  If the tag is in a loop, all values associated with that tag
  should be removed as well.

  syntax:

  save_remove_tag
  loop_
    _old_tag_name
    _old_saveframe

  '_dummy_citation_type'	'save_citation'
  '_redunant_citation_code'	'save_citation'

  effect:

  generic STAR				NMR-STAR

  save_citation				save_citation
  _citation_type  	book		_citation_type	book
  _dummy_citation_type	book		_date 		'97 July 1'

Part 2:  Re-ordering generic STAR to NMR-STAR
------

1) Order of save frames and tags
   Save frames and tags in generic STAR occur in an arbitrary order.
   They have to be re-ordered for NMR-STAR output.

   syntax:
   save_order
   loop_
     _saveframe_name
     _key_tag
     _key_value
     _saveframe_number
     loop_
       _tag_name
       _tag_number

     "save_foo"
     .
     .
     1
     "_foo" 1
     "_bar" 2
     "_zot" 3
    _stop
    *
    "_saveframe_category"
    "bar"
     2
     "_foo" 1
     "_bar" 2
     "_zot" 3
    _stop
    _stop

2) Grouping and printing loops
   There are many ways that tags with multiple values within a save frame
   could be arranged into loops.  For NMR-STAR files, a particular
   association is desired.  In addition, the loops can be written out
   either as tables, with all the values for one iteration of the loop
   on one line, or simply with each value on a separate line.

   syntax:
   save_loops
   loop_
     _saveframe_name
     _key_tag
     _key_value
     _tabulation_flag
     loop_
     _tag_name

   "save_example"
   .
   .
   tabulate
   "_first_name" "_last_name" "_title"
   _stop
   *
   "_saveframe_category"
   "publication"
   linear
   "_publication_name" "_publication_date" "_publication_volume"
   _stop
   _stop


Note:  the information for both of these items can be generated from
the full NMR-STAR file Eldon created.

( New rule:  This will be rule 6, when it is ready. )
-----------------------------------------------------

Rule 6:  Make new tag.
    Creating a new tag by regular expression cut/paste.

    This rule is used when a new tag needs to be created
    by either inserting hardcoded new data, or by copying
    parts of existing data.  This same rule is to be used
    for both creating free tags and creating looped tags.
    (When a looped tag is created, it will be created in its
    own separate loop with just the one tagname.  If there are
    supposed to be many tags collected into one loop, that can
    be done later by the loop-ordering in transform II.)

    The mapping rule for this is complex.  The map rule is a
    nested loop.  The outermost level describes the new tag to
    be created.  The levels inside that describe where to get the
    string to use for its value.  The nesting level can be as
    arbitrarily deep as is needed.  (This will be more obvious as
    the rule is explained).

    The outermost level of the loop describes where the new tag is
    to be put, what it is to be called, and the replacement string
    to use to paste the value into it.  In the simple degenerate
    case, this is just a hardcoded string to fill the new value
    with.  Here is an example:

    simple case: value to paste is a hardcoded literal string:

	save_make_new_tags
	    loop_
		_key_tag_to
		_key_value_to
		_new_tagname_to
		_new_tag_loop_flag_to
		_new_value_to
		loop_
		    ... Note that there will be more inner loop
		    ... levels, but I have not described them yet.
		    loop_
			...etc...

		"_Saveframe_category"
		"entry_information"
		"_NMR_revision_number"
		"N"     # means "NO, this is not going to be a loop."
		'2.1'
		stop_
	    stop_

    The above entry says to find the saveframe where the tag called
    "_Saveframe_category" has the value "entry_information" and
    insert a new tag into it called "_NMR_revision_number" and fill it
    with the simple value 2.1.  Note that whatever quotation delimiter
    technique was used in the mapping file to describe the new value,
    that will be the delimiter used in the new value.  (In the above
    example, the value would be a single-quote delimited string '2.1')

    But there is more to it than that.  The is also a need to be able
    to paste the value from other strings.  To do this we use the
    regular expression search/replace syntax, and add another loop
    level that will define where the values are coming from.  This
    is best explained with an example:

	save_make_new_tags
	    loop_
		_key_tag_to
		_key_value_to
		_new_tagname_to
		_new_tag_loop_flag_to
		_new_value_to
		loop_
		    # The reson for these "_1" numbers will become
		    # apparent later:
		    # --------------------------------------------
		    _key_tag_from_1
		    _key_value_from_1
		    _copy_from_tag_1
		    _copy_from_regex_1
		    loop_
			# There will be even more tags here, but
			# I have not described them yet.
			....

		# As before, the following four fields will define
		# a specific saveframe and tag in that saveframe to
		# create:
		# -------------------------------------------------
		"_Saveframe_category"
		"entry_information"
		"_Full_Author_Name"
		"N"

		# But this time, the _new_value_to field contains these
		# strange backslashed numbers.  They refer to patterns
		# that will be matched down below in the loops under
		# this row.  \1 is the first memorized pattern, \2 is
		# the second memorized pattern, \3 is the third memorized
		# pattern and so on.  There cannot be more than 9
		# memorized patterns \1 through \9.:
		# Notice how this example shows that the same value can
		# be pasted twice (the \1):
		# -------------------------------------------------------
		"Informal Name: \1, Full name: \3, \2 \1"

		    # Now each sub-row of the inner loop contains another
		    # definition of a tag, followed by a regular
		    # expression to pick out parts of the value for that
		    # tag.  Note that saying "SAME SAVEFRAME" for the
		    # key tag and key value is a shorthand for saying that
		    # the same saveframe as the new tag is being created in
		    # is the saveframe to get the tag from.  This is not
		    # 100% the same as simply repeating the same tag/value
		    # keys, as will be explained down below:
		    "SAME SAVEFRAME"
		    "SAME SAVEFRAME"
		    "_First_and_Middle"    # example value: "Steven L."

		    # This is the expression to pull from the tag:
		    # Note that there are two parenthesized expressions
		    # in this example.  One becomes \1 and the other
		    # becomes \2:
		    '([^ \t])$1[ \t]+([A-ZÁ-Ý]\.)$2'
		    stop_

		    # Then more fields can be described as well:
		    "SAME SAVEFRAME"
		    "SAME SAVEFRAME"
		    "_Last"                # example value: "Mading"

		    # Note that the counting of parenthesis starts off
		    # where the last one ended, so since the last
		    # parenthesized expression was called \2,
		    # this next one is going to be called \3:
		    '\(.*\)'   # remember entire string.
		    stop_
	    stop_
    
    In the above example, we see an example of parsing out two
    parts from one string and pasting them back independantly
    (The first name and middle initial were parenthesized
    subsets of the regular expression for parsing the value).

    We also see an example of taking values from two different
    tags and pasting them into one new tag.

    Note the use of "SAME SAVEFRAME" in the above example.  This
    is not just a shorthand for convienience.  It actually has
    important meaning.  If instead of the phrase "SAME SAVEFRAME",
    the actual tag value pair "_Saveframe_category", "entry_information"
    were used, the meaning would have been slightly different.  Had there
    been multiple saveframes in the file that happened to have that
    particular tag/value combination, then giving the tag/value pair
    would have matched *ALL* such saveframes, making it behave much
    like a loop of multiple values (which I haven't explained yet).
    Putting "SAME SAVEFRAME" in for the value indicates that the match
    should be taken ONLY from the saveframe into which the new value is
    being inserted.
    
    Well, there's one more slippery case to deal with: what about when
    the data is supposed to come from many values for a loop, concatenated
    together into one value?  For example, you want to take a loop like
    this in the input file:

	    save_nee
		_Saveframe_category  example_cat

		_people_type   "Inventors of Unix"
		loop_
		    _firstname_and_middle
		    _lastname

		    'Dennis M.'  Ritche
		    'Ken J.'     Thompson
		    'Brian R.'   Kernighan
		stop_
	    save_

    And from that you want to make a tag called "_credits" and you
    want to make it have the value:

    'Inventors of Unix: Dennis Ritche, Ken Thompson, Brian Kernighan'

    (Where the "Inventors of Unix" phrase came from the tag "_people_type"
    and the authors' names came from the loop.)

    Well, the way to do that is to include yet another level of nesting.
    Again, it's easiest to explain with an example:

	save_make_new_tags
	    loop_
		_key_tag_to
		_key_value_to
		_new_tagname_to
		_new_loop_flag_to
		_new_value_to
		loop_
		    _key_tag_from_1
		    _key_value_from_1
		    _copy_from_tag_1
		    _copy_from_regex_1
		    loop_
			# Each level of nesting under this
			# point looks the same, but with the
			# numbers incremented to force the
			# tag names to be unique
			_key_tag_from_2
			_key_value_from_2
			_copy_from_tag_2
			_copy_from_regex_2

		"_Saveframe_category"
		"example_cat"
		"_credits"
		"N"  # No, this is not a loop
		'\1:\2'

		    "SAME SAVEFRAME"
		    "SAME SAVEFRAME"
		    "_people_type"
		    '\(.*\)'       # Remember the whole value as \1
		    stop_

		    "SAME SAVEFRAME"
		    "SAME SAVEFRAME"
		    "SUBPAT CONCAT"  # special flag explained below
		    ' \1 \2,'  # repeat this per loop row, and call it \2

			"SAME SAVEFRAME"
			"SAME SAVEFRAME"
			"_firstname_and_middle"
			'\(.*\) [A-ZÁ-Ý]\.'  # Remember all but the initial.

			"SAME SAVEFRAME"
			"SAME SAVEFRAME"
			"_lastname"
			'\(.*\)'         # Remember the whole value.
			stop_
		    stop_
		stop_
    
    In the above example, the free tag value is handled the same as
    before, and the loop value is handled by creating an intermediate
    level that pastes the loop's values into a pattern and repeats it
    for each row of the loop it finds.  (The ' \1 \2,' pattern prints
    the firstname, then the lastname, then a comma.  It repeats this
    for each row of the loop of names that was found, and the whole
    string itself becomes one of the memorized patterns to paste up
    above.  (it is the \2 value). )  This behavior is activated by
    putting the special keyword "SUBPAT CONCAT" in for the tagname.

    Note that up above I said that if the "SAME SAVEFRAME" flag is
    not used, and instead another keytag/keyvalue pair is given,
    that this means that this *could* match multiple saveframes that
    fit the criteria.  If that is actually the desired effect,
    that you want to paste values from several seperate saveframes,
    then this can be treated just like the loop was in the example
    above.

The above example only deals with how to combine things together
into one value from many, or one value from one.  For cases where
the new data to be created is a *loop* of values, the above
rule is also used.

Now, let's go into examples of what to do if the loop flag is set
to "Y":

    Given the following rule in the mapping file:

	loop_
	    _key_tag_to
	    _key_value_to
	    _new_tagname_to
	    _new_loop_flag_to
	    _new_value_to
	    loop_
		_key_tag_from_1
		_key_value_from_1
		_copy_from_tag_1
		_copy_from_regex_1
		loop_
		    ... etc ...
	    
	    "_Saveframe_category"  "testcat"  "_new_tag1"  "Y" "\1"
		'SAME SAVEFRAME'
		"SAME SAVEFRAME"
		"_orig_tag1"
		'(.*)'  # remember the whole string
		stop_
	    stop_
	stop_

    If the input file had been like this:

	save_tst1
	    _Saveframe_category   testcat

	    _orig_tag1   'original value'
	save_
    
    Then the output file would be like this:

	save_tst1
	    _Saveframe_category   testcat

	    _orig_tag1   'original value'

	    loop_
		_new_tag1
		
		'original value'
	    stop_
	save_
    
    Notice that even though the input only had one match,
    it still put the output in a loop anyway.

    However, if the original file had been like this:
    
	save_tst1
	    _Saveframe_category   testcat

	    loop_
		_some_other_irrelevant_tag1
		_orig_tag1
		_some_other_irrelevant_tag2

		val1	val2	val3
		val4	val5	val6
	    stop_
	save_

    Then the output file would have been like this:

	save_tst1
	    _Saveframe_category   testcat

	    loop_
		_some_other_irrelevant_tag1
		_orig_tag1
		_some_other_irrelevant_tag2

		val1	val2	val3
		val4	val5	val6
	    stop_

	    loop_
		_new_tag1

		val2
		val5
	    stop_
	save_

    Also, the same would be true if, instead of saying "SAME SAVEFRAME",
    a keytag/keyvalue pair  had been used, and there were more than
    one saveframe that matched, as in this example:

	loop_
	    _key_tag_to
	    _key_value_to
	    _new_tagname_to
	    _new_loop_flag_to
	    _new_value_to
	    loop_
		_key_tag_from_1
		_key_value_from_1
		_copy_from_tag_1
		_copy_from_regex_1
		loop_
		    ... etc ...
	    
	    "_Saveframe_category"  "testcat"  "_new_tag1"  "Y" "\1"
		"_Saveframe_category"
		"someothercat"
		"_orig_tag1"
		'(.*)'  # remember the whole string
		stop_
	    stop_
	stop_

	# Given an Input file like this:
	    save_tst1
		_Saveframe_category   testcat

		_dummy_tag 'foo'
	    save_

	    save_tst2
		_Saveframe_category   someothercat

		_orig_tag1   "hello"
	    save_

	    save_tst3
		_Saveframe_category   someothercat

		_orig_tag1   "goodbye"
	    save_

	# Then the output file would be this:
	    save_tst1
		_Saveframe_category   testcat

		_dummy_tag 'foo'
		loop_
		    _new_tag1

		    "hello"
		    "goodbye"
		stop_
	    save_

	    save_tst2
		_Saveframe_category   someothercat

		_orig_tag1   "hello"
	    save_

	    save_tst3
		_Saveframe_category   someothercat

		_orig_tag1   "goodbye"
	    save_

Note that if multiple hits are found, but the rule said the
new tag was not supposed to be in a loop, then only the first
hit will be used, and a warning error will be issued to the
error log.

One more situation to talk about is when there are *some*
things in the replacements patterns that have multiple hits,
and some that don't.  Here is an example:

    The rule looks like this:
	loop_
	    _key_tag_to
	    _key_value_to
	    _new_tagname_to
	    _new_loop_flag_to
	    _new_value_to
	    loop_
		_key_tag_from_1
		_key_value_from_1
		_copy_from_tag_1
		_copy_from_regex_1
		loop_
		    ... etc ...
	    
	    "_Saveframe_category"
	    "testcat"
	    "_new_tag1"
	    "Y"
	    "tag 1 is: \1 tag 2 is: \2"
		"SAME SAVEFRAME"
		"SAME SAVEFRAME"
		"_orig_tag_1"
		'(.*)'  # remember the whole string
		stop_
		"SAME SAVEFRAME"
		"SAME SAVEFRAME"
		"_orig_tag_2"
		'(.*)'  # remember the whole string
		stop_
	    stop_
	stop_
    
    If the input file has this:

	save_tst1
	    _Saveframe_category  testcat

	    _orig_tag_1   "freevalue"
	    loop_
		_orig_tag_2
		_orig_tag_3

		"loopvalue1"	"loopvalue2"
		"loopvalue3"	"loopvalue4"
		"loopvalue5"	"loopvalue6"
	    stop_
	save_

    Then the output file will have this:
	save_tst1
	    _Saveframe_category  testcat

	    _orig_tag_1   "freevalue"
	    loop_
		_orig_tag_2
		_orig_tag_3

		"loopvalue1"	"loopvalue2"
		"loopvalue3"	"loopvalue4"
		"loopvalue5"	"loopvalue6"
	    stop_

	    loop_
		_new_tag1

		"tag 1 is: freevalue tag 2 is: loopvalue1"
		"tag 1 is: freevalue tag 2 is: loopvalue3"
		"tag 1 is: freevalue tag 2 is: loopvalue5"
	save_

    So, the rule is that if *SOME* of the values in the replacement
    patterns are multiple values, but other ones are singular
    values, then the singular values will be re-used as many times
    as is needed to iterate over the multiple values.
