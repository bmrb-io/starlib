DIfferent components of code structure written:


1)ast.h/ast.cc => contains all the constructors for the different sub-data structures making
up the STAR AST

2)astoper.cc  => contains the basic set of primitive functions to manipulate the STAR AST

3) main.cc => A single file containing the set of STAR to NMR-STAR transformations

4) interface.cc/.h => contains functions that allow you to add to the STAR-in memory
data structure

5) unparse.cc => All function to pretty prints a STAR file

6)star.y => YACC specs

7)star.l => LEX spec

8)scopeTagList.cc/h => A convenient data structure defined here and used by transformation 2
