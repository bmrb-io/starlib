    There is a routine in starlib that will format NMRSTAR
    files by setting appropriate comments and by spacing
    the residue sequence codes with multiple iterations per
    text line.  You call this routine just before doing an
    <TT>Unparse()</TT>.
    <P>
    This routine has already been incorporated into a simple
    program that can be called externally, so there are two
    ways now that you can use this code:
    <UL>
	<LI> - As a standalone program:<BR>
		The program is called 'formatNMRSTAR'.  it is
		in the <TT>examples</TT> directory.  It works as a
		simple 'filter', meaning it operates on standard input
		and standard output so you need to use redirection
		like so:
		<PRE>
		    formatNMRSTAR < inputfile > outputfile.
		</PRE>
		This program uses the file /bmrb/lib/comment.str as
		a configuration file that describes the comments
		to be added.  This file can be changed to add more
		comments later.   If an argument is passed to formatNMRSTAR,
		it is the filename to be used instead as the comment file,
		<PRE>
		for example:
		    formatNMRSTAR comment.str < inputfile > outputfile.
		</PRE>
		Included in the examples directory are two such files:
		"comment.str" and "nullcomment.str".  "comment.str" is the
		file to be used for NMR-STAR files.
		<P>
	</LI>
	<LI> - The routine can also be used by a program
	       in the following fashion:
		<OL>
		    <LI> - parse the input StarFileNode into memory.
		    <LI> - parse "comment.str" into memory as
		    a StarFileNode also.
		    <LI> - call this routine:
		    <PRE>
		        formatNMRSTAR( <I><B>StarFileNode to be formatted</B></I>,
			               <I><B>StarFileNode holding the comment.str file</B></I> );
		    </PRE>
		    <LI> - call <TT>Unparse(..)</TT> to print it out.
		</OL>
		These steps are demonstrated as an example in the file
		examples/formatNMRSTAR.cc, which is in the starlib
		CVS project.
