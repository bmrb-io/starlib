    <H1>Starlib: example 1</H1>
    <H2>(Finding something)</H2>
    This example shows how to find a particular tag you are looking
    for.  Let's say that you want to retrieve the data associated
    with the tag called "_Author_name".
    <P>
    Let's assume that you have already read a STAR file into memory
    using <CODE>yyparse()</CODE> as shown in the <A HREF=main.html>
    main example</A>.  This star file is pointed to by the variable
    called <CODE>AST</CODE>
    <P>
    To search for a tag, use the method <CODE>searchByTag()</CODE>.
    This is a member function of <CODE>ASTnode</CODE>, so you can be
    assured that it exists at all levels of the star file tree.
    <PRE>
	List&lt;ASTnode*&gt; *results;
	results = AST-&gt;searchByTag( "_Author_name" );

	<I>Write some code here to look at the </I>results<I> list
	to see what's in it, and do whatever you wanted to do with
	the matches that were found.</I>
        <FONT COLOR=BLUE>
	// You must always delete the list returned by the search
	// function when you are done with it </FONT>
	delete results;
    </PRE>
    At this point, <CODE>results</CODE> is a list of all the hits
    that were returned by <CODE>searchByTag</CODE>.  All the
    searching functions are designed to return a <CODE>List</CODE>
    of hits rather than one single hit, since they could be used
    in places where there are multiple matched items.  For example,
    in this code it is perfectly possible to find multiple tags with
    the name "_Author_name" in different save frames, since we are
    searching the contents of the entire star file.
    <P>
    Now that we have a list of all the matches to "_Author_name",
    we can walk through them all and do whatever it was that was
    intended by this code.  (Note, see list.h for a list of all
    the primitives that can be performed on the List template class):
    <PRE>
	List&lt;ASTnode*&gt; *results;
	results = AST-&gt;searchByTag( "_Author_name" );

	for( results-&gt;Reset() ; ! results-&gt;AtEnd() ; results-&gt;Next() )
	{
	    ASTnode *thisOne = results-&gt;Current();
	    ...
	    <I>Now do whatever you wanted to do with thisOne</I>
	    ...
	}
        <FONT COLOR=BLUE>
	// You must always delete the list returned by the search
	// function when you are done with it </FONT>
	delete results;
    </PRE>
    <P>
    But we have a problem here, and that is that all we have in the
    list of matches are pointers to the generic type <CODE>ASTnode</CODE>.
    What if we were expecting to get a <CODE>DataItemNode</CODE> and we
    wanted to only act on those hits that were <CODE>DataItemNode</CODE>s?
    (In other words, we don't want to operate on any matches we found
    inside a loop.)
    <P>
    This is where the self-awareness of the starlib classes comes in.
    All the classes in starlib are aware of what their own types are.
    (See the functions in <CODE>astnode.h</CODE> for explanations of
    the functions used here.)  Therefore it is possible to query the
    matched nodes and ask them what they are.  Also, each node is aware
    of what STAR file element it is inside of.  (In other words, what
    its parent is in the star file tree).  These two things combined
    can be used to determine what kind of thing the match was found
    inside of.  Going back to the example above, we might add these
    lines:
    <PRE>
	List&lt;ASTnode*&gt; *results;
	results = AST-&gt;searchByTag( "_Author_name" );

	for( results-&gt;Reset() ; ! results-&gt;AtEnd() ; results-&gt;Next() )
	{
	    ASTnode *thisOne = results-&gt;Current();
	    <FONT COLOR=BLUE>
	    // Walk up the parent tree until something that is a
	    // DATAITEMNODE is found, or the root of the tree is
	    // passed up:</FONT>
	    while(   thisOne != NULL  &amp;&amp;
	             ! thisOne-&gt;isOfType( ASTnode::DATAITEMNODE )   )
	    {
		thisOne = thisOne-&gt;myParent();
	    }
	    if( thisOne != NULL )
	    {
	        <I>Now do whatever you wanted to do with thisOne</I>
	    }
	}
        <FONT COLOR=BLUE>
	// You must always delete the list returned by the search
	// function when you are done with it </FONT>
	delete results;
    </PRE>
    The methods shown above, <CODE>isOfType()</CODE> and
    <CODE>myParent()</CODE>, as well as the possible types for
    ASTtype (the argument to <CODE>isOfType()</CODE>) are described in
    <CODE>astnode.h</CODE>
    <P>
    <B><I>NOTE</I></B>: Despite its name, <CODE>searchByTag()</CODE>
    can be used to search for any sort of name, not just tags.  For
    example, you could search for a save frame.
    <P>
    Other similar searching functions that might be of interest are:
    <UL>
	<LI><CODE>searchByTagValue()</CODE>
	    <UL><LI>Searches for a tag that has a particular value.
	    </UL>
	<LI><CODE>searchForTypeByTag()</CODE>
	    <UL><LI>Searches for a tag and returns the node(s) of the
	            given type that contain the match.  For example,
		    to return the entire <CODE>DataLoopNode</CODE> in
		    which a tag appears, rather than the tag itself.
	    </UL>
	<LI></CODE>searchForTypeByTagValue()</CODE>
	    <UL><LI>Searches for a tag that has a particular value,
	            then returns the node(s) that are of the given type
		    that contain the match.
	    </UL>
    </UL>

    These are all described in detail in <CODE>astnode.h</CODE>.
