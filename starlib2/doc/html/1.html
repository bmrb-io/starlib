This struct is used internally to save some space
in each node.  Although bit-fields are often not
worth the effort, in this case they are because
this data could get repeated millions of times in
memory when a large STAR file is parsed. (This
information gets repeated for each DataValueNode in
a loop, for example.)
Any sort of small numeric field used in any derivation
of ASTnode should be put into this union.  (This
drastic measure became necessery when we found that
STAR files more than 5 meg on disk were causing
programs to run out of memory.)
