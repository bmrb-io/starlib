Revision 1.1.1.1  2001/04/17 10:00:42  madings


Revision 2.1  1999/04/28  02:29:00  madings
Made the searchByTag and searchByTagValue functions case-insensitive
for tag-names, datablock names, and saveframe names (but not data values).

Revision 2.0  1999/01/23  03:34:33  madings
Since this new version compiles on
multiple platforms(well, okay, 2 of them), I
thought it warranted to call it version 2.0

Revision 1.12  1999/01/22  23:58:28  madings
Golly, where should I begin?  Okay, There was a port to linux being
done in this version, which in turn meant a port to egcs instead of
making code that can only compile on a CFront style compiler like SGI
uses.  This port meant a lot of tiny changes all over the place to
accomodate the differences in the way templates get linked.  Also,
a bug was discovered in the way rows were deleted in the LoopTableNode's
erase() operator.  The bug was there all along and it surfaced as part
of the portation (what was just bad data in SGI was causing coredumps
in Linux.)  Hopefully now that it compiles under egcs, it will be much
more portable and I can begin getting it out to the public.

Revision 1.11  1998/10/08  03:45:38  madings
Two changes:
1 - Most signifigant change is that the library now has
doc++ comments in it.
2 - Also, changed so that when using the copy constructor,
it remembers line numbers and column numbers in the newly
copied tree (I hope, this is untested.)

Revision 1.10  1998/09/08  00:39:22  madings
My previous fix to the parsing of semicolon delimited strings broke
the line count, which zhaohua showed me.  This has been corrected
in this version.  (Also, irrelevant changes to comments in astnode.h
that don't affect anything are also in this commital)

Revision 1.9  1998/09/04  07:02:06  madings
There were several bug fixes with this version.

However, the erasing probably still needs some work.

Revision 1.8  1998/08/29  08:46:04  madings
This one was a rather large change.  I haven't finished
documenting and testing all of it, so expect another
revision or two soon.

This revision creates a new way of dealing with loops.  Now
the caller can use the loops like 2-D vectors, but with some
extra magic behind the scenes to ensure that no insertions or
deletions that can leave the tree in an invalid state will
be allowed.  (For example, you cannot remove a value from the
loop without also removing the tagname for it and all the other
values in that column.)

Also in this revision is a fix to the previous revision's method
of making List and ASTlist be wrappers around STL vector.  The
previous version of the library broke when the STL library decided
to move the vector to a new location in memory (realloc), and the
myCurrent interator became invalid.  Now myCurrent is an integer
index offset instead, so it moves with the vector.

Also in this revision are some fixes to a longstanding problem that
made the library incapable of parsing nested loops unless the nested
loops were fully populated.  (In other words if an inner loop for any
row was null, because the input file simply has a "stop_" and no
data for the inner loop, it used to crash on that.)  Now it works and
empty inner loops are represented to the caller as null pointers (so
don't blindly follow inner loop pointers that are handed to you - check
them first.)

Note that this marks my first attempt to make a class that implements
the STL vector interface, so I expect to find some bugs to fix in the
next revision or two.  There's some strange C++ "magic" going on here
to get this to work.

Revision 1.7  1998/08/21  02:00:20  informix
Fixed some lex rules so that it handles semicolon strings better.
(  It used to not parse this example:
; This value has some text on the same
line as the starting semicolon.
;
)

Revision 1.6  1998/07/17  01:41:30  madings
Two changes related to Unparse() this revision:
1 - Added the ability to programtically insert comments with
the get/setPreComment functions.
2 - Make Unparse() somewhat more sophisticated to handle formatting
values so they line up with each other.

Revision 1.5  1998/06/02  06:22:03  madings
Made the yacc code that keeps track of lineNum/colNum a bit more
sophisticated so that it shows the locations of the beginnings
of the objects, not the ends of them.  Also gave the base class
'ASTnode' a copy constructor that will copy the increasing number
of variables that are being stored in astnode, like the lineNum/colNum.

Revision 1.4  1998/05/29  06:51:16  madings
Added the ability to search for all objects of a particular AST type.
(i.e. all SaveFrameNodes, or all DataItemNodes, etc...)
See the method called "searchForType()", which was added to do this.

Revision 1.3  1998/05/25  07:15:15  madings
Added preliminary support for keeping track of line numbers and column
numbers from the parse.  This way, programs reading the data can give
the user actual line/column number references to things found in the
STAR file.

Revision 1.2  1998/05/08  20:27:24  informix
Made a change to handle the C++ STL instead of gcc's libg++.
Now all strings are of type 'string' instead of 'String' (notice
the uppercase/lowercase change.)  Applications using this library
will have to change also, unfortunately, to use the new string style.

Revision 1.1.1.1  1998/02/12  20:59:00  informix
re-creation of starlib project, without sb_lib stuff.  sb_lib has
been moved to it's own project.

Revision 1.1.1.1  1997/11/07  01:49:06  madings
First check-in of starlib and sb_lib in library form.

Revision 1.5  1997/10/25  02:59:26  madings
2 Things in this check-in:
-1- "Parallel copy".  Addded a new way to do a copy constructor
such that it will copy with a parallel link back to the
original tree it was copied from.  Any node in either tree
can refer to the corresponding node in the new tree.
See "parallel.html" for more detail.

-2- Bug fixes to copy constructors that did not properly deep-copy
all the way down into the LoopIter values.

Revision 1.4  1997/10/10  18:34:21  madings
Changed DataValueNode so that it now no longer has subclasses for
single-quote-delimited strings, double-quote delimited strings,
semicolon-delimited strings, and so on.  Now there is only one kind
of DataValueNode, and it uses a flag to decide on the delimiter type.
This also allows for the creation of methods to change a DataValueNode
in place, which was not previously possible when different kinds of
values had to be stored in different kinds of classes.

Revision 1.3  1997/10/08  20:23:18  madings
Added "searchForTypeByTag()" and "searchForTypeByTagValue()".

(Also fixed bug where it would not find saveframes.)

Revision 1.2  1997/09/16  22:03:19  madings
Changed searchByTag() and searchByTagValue() so that they will
return lists instead of returning single hits, and extended
them to levels of the star tree above "saveframe" so it is now
possible to use them on the whole star file.
(Also changed the history log comments of several header files
to use slash-star comment style instead of '//' style.)
