    <H1>Starlib: How the list primitives work.</H1>
    (The methods explained here are detailed in <CODE>list.h</CODE>
    and <CODE>astlist.h</CODE> .)
    <P>
    Throughout <CODE>starlib</CODE>, there are many places where
    a linked list is used.  In every one of those cases, the
    following primitive methods can be used on that list.  There
    are really two different classes that use lists.  There is
    the <CODE>List&lt;&gt;</CODE> class and the
    <CODE>ASTlist&lt;&gt;</CODE> class.  <CODE>ASTlist</CODE> is a
    class derived from the base class <CODE>List</CODE>.  Both
    classes are template classes.
    <P>
    The main difference between <CODE>ASTlist</CODE> and
    <CODE>List</CODE> are are so minor that as a user of this
    library, you can ignore the differences.  The <CODE>ASTlist</CODE>
    was developed to keep track of some extra information that is
    needed when handling lists of nodes in a the STAR tree, but the
    differences do not show on the surface, and you can behave as
    if the two classes act the same way:
    <P>
    A list has a concept of its "current" position.  Each list can
    only have one such "current" position.
    <P>
    <B>(Throughout the following list, "T" refers to the type that the
    instantiation of <CODE>List&lt;&gt;</CODE> or
    <CODE>ASTlist&lt;&gt;</CODE> was created to hold.)</B>
    <UL>
	<LI><A NAME="List__constructor"></A>
	    <B><CODE>constructors</CODE></B><BR>
	    The default constructor
	    for a <CODE>List</CODE> creates an empty list.  There is
	    also a copy constructor that copies the contents of one
	    <CODE>List</CODE> into a new one.
	    <P>
	
	<LI><A NAME="List__AddToEnd"></A>
	    <B><CODE>void AddToEnd(T addme)</CODE></B><BR>
	    <B><CODE>void AddToEnd(const List<T> &addme)</CODE></B><BR>
	    This method adds a new object to the end of the list.  There
	    is an overloaded version that will accept another
	    <CODE>List</CODE> as the parameter - this copies the entire
	    contents of the passed list onto the end of this list.
	    <P>
	    Currently there is no provision for adding things to the
	    middle of the list, only at the end.
	    <P>

	<LI><A NAME="List__FreeList"></A>
	    <B><CODE>void FreeList()</CODE></B><BR>
	    Removes the <EM>contents</EM> of the list, but not
	    the list itself.  (In other words, it
	    resets the list back to being empty.)
	    <P>
	
	<LI><A NAME="List__RemoveCurrent"></A>
	    <B><CODE>void RemoveCurrent()</CODE></B><BR>
	    Removes the current
	    node from the list.  The 'current' pointer moves to the
	    next object in the list after the deleted one.
	    <P>
	
	<LI><A NAME="List__AlterCurrent"></A>
	    <B><CODE>void AlterCurrent(T setToMe)</CODE></B><BR>
	    Replaces the current node of the list with the given
	    value.
	    <P>
	
	<LI><A NAME="List__MemorizeCurrent"></A>
	    <B><CODE>void MemorizeCurrent()</CODE></B><BR>
	    This method tells the object to remember where its
	    current pointer is, so it can be restored to that
	    position later.  Each object of type <CODE>List</CODE>
	    can only remember one such value at a time.
	    <P>

	<LI><A NAME="List__RestoreCurrent"></A>
	    <B><CODE>void RestoreCurrent()</CODE></B><BR>
	    Restores a list to the position it was at when
	    <CODE>MemorizeCurrent()</CODE> was called. (see above).
	    <P>

	
	<LI><A NAME="List__Length"></A>
	    <B><CODE>int Length() const</CODE></B><BR>
	    Returns the number of nodes in the list.
	    <P>
	
	<LI><A NAME="List__Lookup"></A>
	    <B><CODE>bool Lookup(T findMe)</CODE></B><BR>
	    Searches for an object that is equal to the object
	    passed (If the class passed has had its '==' operator
	    redifined, then the redefined version will be used for
	    this check.)  If the object is found in the list,
	    <CODE>true</CODE> is returned.
	    <P>
	
	<LI><A NAME="List__SeekTo"></A>
	    <B><CODE>bool SeekTo(T findMe)</CODE></B><BR>
	    Like <A HREF=List__Lookup><CODE>Lookup()</CODE></A>, but
	    it also moves the current pointer to the location
	    given.
	    <P>
	
	<LI><A NAME="List__Reset"></A>
	    <B><CODE>void Reset()</CODE></B><BR>
	    Moves the current to the start of the list.
	    <P>
	
	<LI><A NAME="List__Next"></A>
	    <A NAME="List__Prev"></A>
	    <B><CODE>void Next()</CODE></B><BR>
	    <B><CODE>void Prev()</CODE></B><BR>
	    These methods move the current to the
	    next or previous node in the list.
	    <P>
	
	<LI><A NAME="List__AtEnd"></A>
	    <A NAME="List__AtStart"></A>
	    <B><CODE>bool AtEnd()</CODE></B><BR>,
	    <B><CODE>bool AtStart()</CODE></B><BR>
	    Returns <CODE>true</CODE> if the current has
	    passed the end of the list for <CODE>AtEnd()</CODE>, or
	    is at the start of the list for <CODE>AtStart()</CODE>
	    <P>
	
	<LI><A NAME="List__Current"></A>
	    <B><CODE>T Current() const</CODE></B><BR>
	    Returns a copy of the contents of the current node of the list.
	    <P>
	
	<LI><A NAME="List__Last"></A>
	    <B><CODE>T Last() const</CODE></B><BR>
	    Returns a copy of the last element of the list.
	    <P>
	
	<LI><A NAME="List__operator"></A>
	    <B><CODE>operator ==</CODE></B><BR>
	    The '==' operator is overridden so that it is possible
	    to compare two lists and ask "Do these lists have the
	    same contents?"
	    <P>
