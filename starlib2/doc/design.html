    <H1>Starlib's basic design</H1>
    <P>
    The starlib is a collection of C++ classes that are used to
    build up a picture in memory of a star file on the disk.
    This picture in memory of a star file is in a 'tree' format,
    which follows a very close parallel to the BNF grammar of a
    STAR file.
    <P>
    All the classes in a STAR file tree are derived from a base class
    called <CODE><B>ASTnode</B></CODE>.  All the classes inherit some
    basic behaviors from this base class.  Much of the useful
    functionality of the STAR file can be found right in this base class.
    <P>
    At this point the out-of-line documentation is not 100% of
    what you need to know to make use of starlib.  Much of the
    functionality of the starlib is explained within the header files
    themselves.
    <P>
    At minimum, you should read these header files, in the order shown:
    <PRE>
	astnode.h    // The base class - lots of useful methods
	                 // are explained in here.
	list.h       // A basic list primitive that is used in the code.
	astlist.h    // A derivation of the basic list primitive that
	                 // is almost identical to list.h in its
			 // interface, but it does more 'behind the
			 // scences'. than list.h
	ast.h        // The file describing all the functions in all the
	                 // classes of the starlib.
			 // The really important methods will have
			 // large comments explaining them.  Methods 
			 // that are undocumented are probably not as
			 // important for the user of the library.
    </PRE>
    <P>
    One intended goal for the future is to create better documentation
    of these functions, but when the code and the documentation are
    maintained in seperate locations, this inevitably results in
    discrepencies.  A program to create documentation from the header
    files themselves (such as is done in Java) would be helpful, and
    several such programs exist for C++, and I am considering them.
    <P>
    The remainder of the documentation files deal with examples and
    code snippets demonstrating ways to use the library.
