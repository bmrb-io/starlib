    <H1>Starlib: example 2</H1>
    <H2>(Deleting something)</H2>
    This example shows how to delete something.
    <P>
    Let's assume that you have already read a STAR file into memory
    using <CODE>yyparse()</CODE> as shown in the <A HREF=main.html>
    main example</A>.  This star file is pointed to by the variable
    called <CODE>AST</CODE>
    <P>
    To delete something you must first get a pointer to it via
    one of the searching techniques, then you delete that pointer.
    It's that simple.  Almost.
    <P>
    The destructors for the various nodes are set up to automatically
    remove a node from its parent when it gets deleted via the
    <CODE>delete</CODE> operator.  So to delete a DataItemNode,
    simply use the <CODE>delete</CODE> operator on it.  To delete
    a save frame, get a pointer to it and use the <CODE>delete</CODE>
    operator on it.
    <P>
    The place where this idea breaks down is where deleting something
    causes descrepencies to appear in the STAR tree.  For example,
    it makes no sense to delete a single DataValueNode from inside a
    loop, leaving a "hole".  Therefore, it is sometimes dangerous to
    delete something directly from a star file tree.  The table below
    should help sort things out.
    <P>
    The following is a list of types of nodes where it is safe to
    use the delete operator directly to delete a node:

    Here's an example code snippet to delete a saveframe called
    "save_delete_me":
    <PRE>
	<FONT COLOR=BLUE>//Assume "AST" is a ptr to a StarFileNode:</FONT>
	List&lt;ASTnode*&gt; *matches = AST-&gt;searchByTag( "save_delete_me" );
	<FONT COLOR=BLUE>
	//In reality, we know that there should be one match, so this
	//for-loop is probably overkill:</FONT>
	for( matches-&gt;Reset() ; ! matches-&gt;AtEnd() ; matches-&gt;Next() )
	    if( matches-&gt;Current()-&gt;isOfType( ASTnode::SAVEFRAME )
		delete matches-&gt;Current();
        <FONT COLOR=BLUE>
	// You must always delete the list returned by the search
	// function when you are done with it </FONT>
	delete results;
    </PRE>
    Here is an example to delete all DataItemNodes that have a
    tag name "_Author_first_name" with a value of "Zaphod":
    <PRE>
	<FONT COLOR=BLUE>//Assume "AST" is a ptr to a StarFileNode:</FONT>
	List&lt;ASTnode*&gt; *matches =
	    AST-&gt;searchForTypeByTagValue(
	       ASTnode::DATAITEMNODE, "_Author_first_name", "Zaphod" );

	for( matches-&gt;Reset() ; ! matches-&gt;AtEnd() ; matches-&gt;Next() )
	    delete matches-&gt;Current();
        <FONT COLOR=BLUE>
	// You must always delete the list returned by the search
	// function when you are done with it </FONT>
	delete results;
    </PRE>
    Here is an example to delete from within a loop the column
    with the name "_looptag2".  Note that because you are not supposed
    to directly delete the DataNameNodes that are inside a loop
    (according to the chart above), you must use a different technique
    here, namely calling the <CODE>RemoveColumn</CODE> method of
    <CODE>DataLoopNode</CODE>:
    <PRE>
	<FONT COLOR=BLUE>//Assume "AST" is a ptr to a StarFileNode:</FONT>
	List&lt;ASTnode*&gt; *matches = AST-&gt;searchForTag( "_looptag2" );

	for( matches-&gt;Reset() ; ! matches-&gt;AtEnd() ; matches-&gt;Next() )
	{
	    ASTnode *cur = matches-&gt;Current();
	    <FONT COLOR=BLUE>
	    // Walk up the parent list until the loop that this match
	    // was found inside of is reached.  If this match was not
	    // inside a loop, then this will walk all the way up to
	    // the root and eventually reach NULL.</FONT>
	    while(  cur != NULL  &amp;&amp;
	            ! cur-&gt;isOfType( ASTnode::DATALOOPNODE )  )
	    {   cur = cur-&gt;myParent();
	    }
	    <FONT COLOR=BLUE>
	    // If we reached NULL, then the match was not in a loop,
	    // so only do something if it did not reach NULL: </FONT>
	    if( cur != NULL )
	    {   ((DataLoopNode*)cur)-&gt;RemoveColumn( "_looptag2" );
	    }
	}
        <FONT COLOR=BLUE>
	// You must always delete the list returned by the search
	// function when you are done with it </FONT>
	delete results;
    </PRE>
