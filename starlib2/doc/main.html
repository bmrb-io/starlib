    <H1>Starlib: How to write your main program</H1>

    These steps show how to write a main program using the starlib.
    <P>
    <HR WIDTH=50%>
    <H3><CENTER>#includes</CENTER></H3>
    Every module in a starlib-using program should contain the following
    includes:
    <PRE>
	#include &lt;fstream.h&gt;
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
        #include "ast.h"
	#include "parser.h"
	#include "scanner.h"
    </PRE>
    <H3><CENTER>Global variables</CENTER></H3>
    There must exist the following two global variables in the program:<BR>
    <PRE>
        StarFileNode  *AST;   // StarFileNode is defined in "ast.h"
	ofstream      *os;    // ofstream is in the standard libc++.
    </PRE>
    <H3><CENTER>Initialization</CENTER></H3>
    The global variables mentioned above are used like this:
    <UL>
	<LI><CODE><B>*AST</B></CODE> is a pointer that will be filled
	    by the parser when it reads a star file into memory.  Due
	    to the limitations of lex/yacc parsers, such a global
	    variable must be used.  If you wish to read more than one
	    star file, you will need to read the first star file into
	    the AST variable, then copy it to another StarFileNode using
	    the StarFileNode's copy constructor, then read the next file
	    into the AST variable.  Also note that since AST is a pointer,
	    the it is up to you to delete the space (<CODE>delete AST;</CODE>)
	    when done with it.

	<LI><CODE><B>*os</B></CODE> is a pointer to a C++ output stream.
	    This is used by the <CODE>Unparse()</CODE> function.
	    <CODE>Unparse()</CODE> is a method that will write out
	    the STAR file in memory (or just a portion of it) to a
	    file.  Unparse() is hardwired to write its output to the
	    stream called <CODE>(*os)</CODE>.  Therefore, to decide
	    where the file is to be written to, you open the
	    <CODE>*os</CODE> file yourself before calling <CODE>Unparse()
	    </CODE>.  <B>NOTE</B>: One common mistake has been for
	    people to forget to close the <CODE>(*os)</CODE> output stream,
	    and therefore the last lines of output never flush into the
	    file.

	<LI><CODE><B>yyin</B></CODE> is not something that you need to
	    put in your global variables section, but it is included
	    as part of the parser.  The parser that reads in a STAR file
	    will read it from the file <CODE>yyin</CODE>.  <CODE>yyin</CODE>
	    is an Ansii C (<CODE>FILE *</CODE>) file.  You are expected
	    to open this file before calling <CODE>yyparse()</CODE>, so
	    that <CODE>yyparse()</CODE> knows what file to parse.
    </UL>

    <HR WIDTH=50%>
    <H3>This is an example of code to illustrate all the above steps</H3>
    <P>
    This code will parse in a star file called "input.star", and write it
    out under the name "output.star".  The example doesn't do anything
    else, but you can use it as a skeleton from which to base your own
    code.
    <P>
    Don't be overwhelmed if you don't understand everything here, but
    you should be able to understand the use of <CODE>*os</CODE>, 
    <CODE>*AST</CODE>, and <CODE>yyin</CODE>.

    if( yyin == NULL )

    }

    if( yyparse() == 0 )  // yyparse returns nonzero on error.
    {
	// It was successfully parsed, now *AST contains the
	// file in memory.  For this simple example, we will
	// just Unparse it right away and quit.
	// -------------------------------------------------
        os = new ofstream( "output.star" );

	{   cerr &lt;&lt; "Error opening output.star\n";
	    return 1;
	}
	AST-&gt;Unparse(0); // Unparse takes 1 arg: the indent level:

	delete os;   // C++ streams are closed by calling the delete
	             // operator.  If you do not close it, it might
		     // not flush the last line or two of the output.
	delete AST;
    }
