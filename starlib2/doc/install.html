    <H1>"starlib" installation instructions.</H1>

    <P>

    <H3>INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:</H3>

    <H4>What you need before you begin:</H4>
    <UL>
	<LI>Some Unix shell prompt knowlege so that these
	Instructions can be followed easily.
	<P>
	<LI>A computer platform to compile C++:  Right now the two
	known working platforms are Irix with CC and Red hat Linux 5.2.
	with egcs 1.1.1.  There is nothing in the code that is
	<em>intentionally</em> dependant upon proprietary compiler
	extensions, so the code should be able to port to other platforms
	with a minimum of effort.  Irix and RedHat Linux 5.2 are 
	simply the only platforms within easy reach for the development
	team to use.  The code might port to other platforms and you are
	welcome to try (and e-mail portability suggestions back to the
	developers for inclusion in future releases.)
	<P>
	<LI>A C++ STL class library with the "basic_string" class and the
	vector<> class.  The code compiles under Irix with CC and under
	Linux with egcs 1.1.1 (which is <em>not</em> the version of egcs
	that ships with RedHat 5.2 - you will need to download and install
	it from <A HREF=http://www.cygnus.com/egcs>Cygnus</A>.)
	<P>
	<LI><CODE>gunzip</CODE> and <CODE>tar</CODE> for extraction.
	<P>
	<LI>The FSF's lex and yacc replacements called
	<CODE>bison</CODE> and <CODE>flex</CODE>.  The code should
	also work with any generic lex/yacc (with a modification to the
	Makefile), but this is untested.
    </UL>

    <U>Follow the steps...</U>
    <P>
    <OL>
	<LI>Get the starlib.tar.gz file from BMRB.</LI>
	<P>

	<LI>Unpack the archive file with this command:<BR>
	    <CODE>gunzip --stdout starlib.tar.gz | tar xvf -</CODE>
	<P>
	
	<LI><CODE>cd starlib</CODE>
	<P>

	<LI>Edit the "Makefile".  Uncomment the appropriate section for
	    your particular OS/compiler.  Also change the appropriate
	    defines that set up where the compiler is on your system, if
	    need be.
	    <P>
	    I apologise for not using something like GNU autoconf, but
	    we have not had time to convert to it.  I am interested in
	    any systems on which this code is known to compile, and the 
	    Makefile that was used to do so.  If you change the Makefile
	    and it compiles, please let BMRB know so we can make it
	    part of the standard install in a later version.  (e-mail
	    address can be found at the bottom of this document).
	    <P>
	<P>

	<LI>Issue the command: <CODE>make</CODE>
	<P>

	<LI>If it works, copy the resulting libstar.a file to a
	    location where you intend to use it, and copy all the
	    header files in this directory (*.h) to a location
	    where a program using this library can find them using
	    the '-I' option to the compiler.
	    <P>
	    If you don't mind the clutter, you can just use the directory
	    in which you just built starlib for this purpose.
	    <P>
	    If you are like me and prefer to read the header files,
	    to see the exact prototypes in addition to using the
	    documentation, I recommend that you read them in the
	    order shown here for maximum understandability:
	    <UL>
		<LI><CODE>astnode.h</CODE>
		<LI><CODE>list.h</CODE>
		<LI><CODE>astlist.h</CODE>
		<LI><CODE>ast.h</CODE>
	    </UL>

	<P>
	<LI><A HREF=using_compile.html>Read the next topic</A>, "Using
	    the library" for instructions on how to make use of
	    <CODE>libstar.a</CODE> in your own code.
    </OL>
