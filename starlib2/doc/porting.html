    <H1>"starlib" porting notes.</H1>

    <HR>
    The starlib was first developed on an SGI Irix 6.2 machine.
    Due to some strange things that that platform does, and due to
    the fact that the C++ STL standard was still in the process of
    being ratified when it was created, there is a portation
    problem that will come up when you try to move this to a different
    platform:
    <P>
    <UL>
	<LI>SGI's 'CC' compiler did not implement the C++ "string" class
	    in the normal location.  With SGI, if you #include the file
	    "&lt;string.h&gt;", you end up with the old-fashioned Ansi-C
	    string header file (the one with <CODE>strcat()</CODE>,
	    <CODE>strcmp()</CODE>, <CODE>strlen()</CODE>, etc...)  The new
	    C++ standard says that it should give you the C++ string class,
	    but for whatever reasons, SGI didn't want to do it that way.
	    Their C++ string class is in a file called "mstring.h".
	    Knowing that this would be a problem, I created a seperate file
	    called <CODE>portatbility.h</CODE>, which contains the include
	    of <CODE>mstring.h</CODE>.  To fix this for other non-SGI
	    platforms, simply edit <CODE>portability.h</CODE>, and change
	    the string include to whatever is appropriate to your system.
	    In future, SGI claims to have a better, more compliant C++
	    library with their compiler.  When this happens, I will be able
	    to fix this annoyance.
