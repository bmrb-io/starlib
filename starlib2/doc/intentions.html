    <H1>Intentions of the starlib library.</H1>
    This brief overview describes what the starlib library is
    intended to be used for, and what it is not intended to be
    used for.
    <HR WIDTH=50% HEIGHT=8>
    <CODE><B>starlib</B></CODE> is a library originally developed
    internally at BMRB for use with the NMR-STAR file format.
    However, it is generic enough that it should be usable on
    any STAR file format, such as CIF.  <CODE>starlib</CODE>
    does not make any attempt to provide a way to search multiple
    STAR files as if they were a database.  <CODE>starlib</CODE> is
    intended primarily for use with one single STAR file.
    <P>
    At BMRB, STAR files are intended to be used only as a means of
    transporting data between formats.  It is a long-range goal of
    BMRB to eventually create a database schema for relational access
    to the data that is currently kept in NMR-STAR files.  Therefore
    the <CODE>starlib</CODE> library does not attempt to provide a
    relational access paradigm.
    <P>
    What the <CODE>starlib</CODE> library does do is to provide a
    means of searching through a STAR file for data and manipulating
    that data.  The intention is to do this in a way that the programmer
    can use similar functionality throughout the STAR file, where
    possible.  As an example of this, the function to search for a
    tag in a save frame is the same as the name of a function to
    search for a tag in an entire STAR file.
    <P>
    Please do keep in mind, however, that this is the first version
    of this library.  Suggestions as to how the interface could be
    improved are welcome.
