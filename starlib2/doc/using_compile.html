    <H1>Using starlib - how to compile in your code.</H1>

    <P>
    Currently, starlib does not install itself into any standard
    system library directories, although you are certainly free to
    do so if you chose, and have root access, by copying libstar.a
    into <CODE>/usr/local/lib</CODE> and copying the header files
    into <CODE>/usr/local/include</CODE>.)  The most likely way that
    this first version of starlib will be used is on only one or two
    programs, and not installed into the general Unix library
    heirarchy.  These instructions will assume that this is how you
    are using starlib.
    <P>
    <P>
    After running the instructions in the the <A HREF=install.html>
    install page</A>, you will have a collection of <CODE>*.h</CODE>
    files and a single <CODE>libstar.a</CODE> file, and several *.o
    files, one of which is called <CODE>template.o</CODE>.  Once the
    compile is finished, you can delete all the *.o files, except for
    the one called <CODE>template.o</CODE> - that one is needed for
    linking with programs that use starlib.
    <P>
    In general, to make use of starlib in your program, you must
    include the <CODE>"ast.h"</CODE> file from this starlib directory.
    It will weave its way through all the other header files such that
    you should only need to include <CODE>"ast.h"</CODE> in your code.
    <P>
    In general, when compiling an executable using starlib, you must
    remember to add <CODE>"-lstar -ll"</CODE> to the end of the final
    link command.  (The <CODE>-ll</CODE> is needed to make the
    star file parser work.  It brings in a library used by the
    "lex" routines.)  Also, you need to link in the <CODE>template.o</CODE>
    file with your final link.  The reason for linking the template.o
    file is that the method used by the compiler to resolve C++ template
    instantiations on SGI fails to notice the templates when they are
    contained in a library .a file.  Other compilers might not have this
    problem, and if you are using this on a different compiler, the
    inclusion of <CODE>template.o</CODE> on the final link might not
    be needed.
    <P>
    To implement the above, assuming you are using a Makefile in your
    project, and that you made the files in a directory called
    "starlib", make these changes yo your Makefile:

    Add these lines near the top: <BR>
    <UL><LI>
    <PRE>
        # The directory the star library exists for you.  Change this
	# to whatever is appropriate for where you installed it:
	STARLIBDIR = ~/starlib
	
	# The flags to give the compiler:
	STARFLAGS = -L$(STARLIBDIR) -I$(STARLIBDIR)
	STARLIBS = $(STARLIBDIR)/template.o -lstar -ll
    </PRE>
    </UL>

    Insert this change to every compile statement in your Makefile:
    If it used to say something like this: <BR>
    <UL><LI>
    <PRE>
	# (This is a compile to an object file (no executable link):
	$(CC) -c ...stuff...
    </PRE>
    </UL>
    <BR>make it say this instead:<BR>
    <UL><LI>
    <PRE>
	$(CC) $(STARFLAGS) ...stuff...
    </PRE>
    </UL>
    On the other hand, If it used to say something like this: <BR>
    <UL><LI>
    <PRE>
	# (This is a compile to executable file (does the final link):
	$(CC) ...stuff...
    </PRE>
    </UL>
    <BR>make it say this instead:<BR>
    <UL><LI>
    <PRE>
	$(CC) $(STARFLAGS) ...stuff... $(STARLIBS)
    </PRE>
    </UL>

    <P>
    These instructions are crude, but they get you the idea.  They give
    you a solution that is not clean, but works.  You can of course
    make your Makefile nicer once you understand what the above
    instructions are doing.
