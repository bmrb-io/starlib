    <P>
    Sometimes it is useful to make a copy of a starfile tree in
    such a way that, given a node in one of the trees, it is
    possible to find the same corresponding node in the other tree.
    (At least, we found it useful to do this at BMRB, so we are
    including the functions that did this in the public distribution
    of the library, in the hopes that someone else might find it
    useful also.)
    <P>
    <EM>If you do not need to use this parallel link feature, then it
    is highly reccomended that you use the ordinary copy constructor
    to create a copy of a starfile tree.</EM>
    <P>
    Specificly, the place where we found this a useful thing to do
    was in our "s2nmr" program.  This program converted Star files
    from an intermediate format used by the web pages into the final
    NMR-STAR format.  This program required that we make a copy of the
    starfile tree, search for some tags in the original tree, and then
    perform certain operations, not on those tags themselves, but on
    their counterparts in the new copy of the tree.
    <P>
    This ability is admitedly limited, though.  You can only make one
    copy of a tree at a time using these functions, due to the limited
    way this feature is implemented behind the scenes.  If you want to
    copy tree A into tree B, and then copy tree A into tree C, using
    these parallel links, then you will have to delete tree A or tree B
    first.  A starfile tree cannot be linked to more than one other
    'parallel' partner starfile tree at a time.  This rule is enforced 
    in the parallel copy function.  If you attempt to use the parallel
    copy function to create a parallel copy of a tree that already has
    a parallel peer, the function will fail and return NULL.
    <P>
    Again, it should be repeated that: 
    <EM>If you do not need to use this parallel link feature, then it
    is highly reccomended that you use the ordinary copy constructor
    to create a copy of a starfile tree.</EM>
    <P>
    When two starfile trees are linked in parallel like this, you can
    simply delete one of them to break the link.  The destructors will
    unlink it from its parallel peer, and the parallel peer can then
    be used to make another parallel copy.
    <P>
    Note that once the copy is made, the two trees are indeed "peers"
    in that they retain no knowlede of which tree was the original
    tree and which was the copy.  Either one can deleted when finished,
    and the other one will automatically 'lose' all knowlege of its
    parallel peer.
    <P>
    
    <H3>Methods list:</H3>
    These methods (functions) are all part of the main base
    type <CODE>ASTnode</CODE>.  Thus they can be used at any
    level of the star tree.  (For example, you could call a
    DataLoopNode's parallel copy constructor method to copy just
    that DataLoopNode rather than an entire Star File tree.  Normally,
    when an entire star file needs to be parallel copied, you would
    call the StarFileNode's parallel copy constructor method.

    <UL>
	<LI>
	    <H4><CODE>(Constructors)</CODE></H4>
	    Each ASTnode will have a new constructor to be
	    used when you want to create a parallel copy with
	    links.  It will work just like the regular
	    copy constructor, except that you pass a flag
	    determining whether or not you want a link to
	    be made:  Here is an example:
	    <PRE>

	        StarFileNode *original;
		StarfileNode *copy;

		...

		copy = new StarFileNode( true, *original );

	    </PRE>
	    This creates the new Star File with the proper links
	    in place.<BR>
	    <EM>The old copy constructors still exist, so you
	    do not need to change every line of code to comply
	    with this new convention.  The following two
	    lines of code are exactly equivilent:</EM>
	    <PRE>
		StarFileNode * copy = new StarFileNode( s );
		StarFileNode * copy = new StarFileNode( false, s );
	    </PRE>
	    <P>
	</LI>
	<LI>
	    <H4><CODE>ASTnode *myParallelCopy( void )</CODE></H4>
	    This method returns a pointer to an ASTnode.  The
	    ASTnode returned is the parallel 'other' version of
	    this node in the parallel tree.  Incedentally, since
	    the two parallel trees are aware of each other, the
	    parallel copy of the parallel copy is the orginial
	    node, so this function is self-inverting, like this:
	    <BR>
	    <CODE>foo-&gt;myParallelCopy()-&gt;myParallelCopy() == foo </CODE>
	    <BR>
	    <EM>If there is no parallel node corresponding to this
	    node, then this method will return a NULL pointer.  This
	    can happen if a node in the parallel tree was deleted
	    after the parallel copy was made.</EM>
	    <P>
	</LI>
	<LI>
	    <H4><CODE><EM>(The Destructor)</EM></CODE></H4>
	    The destructor of <CODE>ASTnode</CODE> (and all types
	    derived from <CODE>ASTnode</CODE>) is set up to look
	    for a parallel copy, and if there is one, to unlink it
	    from this node before this node gets destroyed.
	    Therefore when you have a pair of parallel star trees,
	    and you delete one of them, or just a node in one of
	    them, then the corresponding nodes in the parallel tree
	    will become unlinked from this node that is about to die.
	    In the extreme case, when a parallel copy of a
	    <CODE>StarFileNode</CODE> is made, and then later one of
	    the pair of <CODE>StarFileNode</CODE>s is deleted, then
	    the other <CODE>StarFileNode</CODE> is completely
	    unlinked from the deleted tree, and can be used to
	    create another parallel copy if so desired.
