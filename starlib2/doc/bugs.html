    <H1>Starlib: Known Bugs</H1>

    This is a list of some of the known bugs and "features" of
    starlib.  Please check here before e-mailing any bug reports
    to the starlib maintainer (that would be me).

    <H3>Bug List</H3>
    <UL>
	<LI>
	    <I>global_</I>: The handling of the <CODE>global_</CODE> keyword
	    is not correct when more than one <CODE>global_</CODE> keyword
	    exists in the file.  As of right now, there is no relationship
	    between saveframes and datablocks and the global tags that
	    were in effect when they were read in.  The starlib in-memory
	    representation of a global_ block only allows one such block
	    to exist for an entire file.  If more than one global_ block
	    is encountered, then both are concatenated into one global_
	    block in memory, with no record of which global_ parameters
	    were in effect at what point in the file.
	    <P>
	<LI>
	    <I>duplicate names</I>: Right now there is no double-checking
	    to ensure that the STAR file has no duplicatated names.  For
	    example, it is possible to have two tags with the same name
	    in the same saveframe.  It is also possible to have two
	    saveframes with the same name, and two datablocks with the
	    same name.  Putting this check in place would greatly slow
	    down the insertion of new nodes to the star tree, since each
	    insertion would require that there be a check for duplicate
	    names, and each time a tag is renamed, a similar check would
	    be needed.
