<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>
    This document covers changes from the old starlib (starlib1) to the new
    starlib (starlib2).  The changes were cheifly to allow starlib to
    now handle much larger files than it could previously.
</FONT>
<P>
<STRONG>These changes WILL require some small alterations to code that
uses the library.  </STRONG> It is essential that any programmer using
starlib2 read this page first before making the change from starlib1
to starlib2.  These changes affect the C++ programs using starlib,
not the Java programs using starlibj.
<P>
<H3>Why the change?</H3>
The reason this change was made was that the old starlib could not
handle files with large tables in them without using an impractically
large amount of memory that won't fit in most machines.  Sometimes
values that only took 2 bytes to express in the star file took 56
bytes to express in memory.  This was for each and every value in
a loop_ in a star file.
<P>
<H3>Why a new version number?</H3>
The reason this is now called starlib2 instead of starlib1 is that
the change is large enough that it would be a bad idea for programmers
to upgrade to starlib2 without first reading this document and
understanding what it means.
<P>
<H3>Okay, what was changed?</H3>
The new starlib now stores each row of a loop_ as a single object in
memory.  Whenever your application program uses one of the methods
of LoopRowNode to get a DataValueNode, what is really happening is
that a shadow DataValueNode is being created and put into a cache.
Until your application tries to access a DataValueNode, that
DataValueNode doesn't really exist as an independant object yet.
It is merely a substring embedded inside a LoopRowNode object.
When you are done using the DataValueNodes, then the cache is
flushed and the memory it was taking up goes away.  When you make
changes to a DataValueNode, the change actually takes effect in
the cache and won't get copied back into the LoopRowNode until you
flush the cache.  If you try to access a DataValueNode that has
already been brought into the cache, you simply get a pointer to
the value that is already in the cache.
<P>
<H3>Great, so how does this affect my program?</H3>
Well, for the most part, it doesn't.  Your program still works the
same way it did before, except for the following new things you need
to add to it:
<OL>
    <LI> - At reasonable points in your code (explained below),
    you should make a call to a new routine called <A HREF="#flush">
    <CODE>ValCache::flushValCache()</CODE></A> to clear out the cache
    of any DataValueNodes there may be.</LI>
    <LI> - You must not try to use any DataValueNode pointers or
    references that were created before the call to
    <CODE>flushValCache()</CODE> in code that is executed after the call to
    <CODE>flushValCache()</CODE>.</LI>
    <LI> - Do not attempt to use the <CODE>myParallelCopy()</CODE>
    method on the level of a DataValueNode.  It might still work, but
    not reliably so.  This is because DataValueNode objects no longer have
    persistance within the run of the program and so the parallel
    references don't have anywhere permanent to point to at this level.</LI>
    <LI> - Be aware that every call to Unparse() will also result in
    a call to ValCache::flushValCache() and therefore invalidate your
    DataValueNode pointers.
</OL>
<P>
Let's explain those in detail below:
<A NAME="flush"></A>
<H3>flushValCache()</H3>
There is now a public static method called
<CODE>void ValCache::flushValCache(void)</CODE>.  Whenever your
program is finished using any DataValueNode pointers it may be
holding on to, it should call this method.  It is safe to call the
method as many times as you wish, so long as you never use
DataValueNode pointers you created before the flush once the flush
has occurred.  Here is an example of okay usage, and bad usage:

<P>
In general, memory size usage vs CPU usage is a tradeoff.  If you flush
too often, then you are wasting too much CPU time, but if you flush
not often enough, then your program might end up using entirely too
much memory on larger files.  As a general rule of thumb, it's a
good idea to flush at the bottom of major code loops, especially if you
know the code loop will be iterating over a column in a very large STAR
loop.
<P>
<H3>Loop Flushing</H3>
<P>
There also exists a <CODE>flushValCache()</CODE> at the LoopTableNode
level.  You may use this to flush just the values in that one loop,
rather than all the ones that exist in the entire program.
<P>
<H3>Why all this work?</H3>
It might seem like the library is offloading work onto you, the
application programmer, that really belongs in the library.  This
I can sympathize with.  However, this is caused by a limitation in
the C++ language, and I haven't thought of a way to get around it.
C++ pointers and references do not notify the library when they
go out of scope.  C++ does not do native garbage collection.  Becasue
of this, the library can't tell when you are done using a pointer or
reference it has handed to you.  This is why you need to call
the flush routine yourself.  When you call flushValCache, you are 
essentially telling the library, "I am now done with all those
DataValueNode pointers I was holding on to.  You may act as if
they just went out of scope and I won't be using them again."
<HR>
<H3>HOW TO LINK</H3>
Simple.  Just alter your makefile's -I and -L statements to
link to a starlib2 directory instead of starlib, and check out
starlib2 to a directory at a peer level to where you checked out
starlib.  Remember to make sure you do a make clean first, so
you don't get object mismatches during linking.
